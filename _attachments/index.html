                        <h3>About</h3>
                        <p>This visualization illustrates the number of cards I received over the course of the 12 months I spent in Pittsburgh working on my Masters degree. An average of just over 2 cards per month. As the year progressed I began collecting these cards on the mantlepiece of my apartment. By the end of the year the mantle was covered end-to-end, two cards deep in some places. It was striking to see all those cards together like that and I wanted to share that feeling with a larger audience as a way to thank everyone that encouraged me or remembered my birthday while I was working on my degree.</p>

                        <p>I&rsquo;m not sure this visualization has quite the same impact as the row of cards displayed above the fireplace in my apartment, but it does show how many of my friends and family&mdash;including my parents&rsquo; dog&mdash;thought of me while I was sequestered in our lab space at 300 S. Craig St. in Pittsburgh.</p>

                        <h3>Description</h3>
                        <p>The outer ring of the diagram represents the proportions of the dominant colors present in each greeting card I received. Each section in the next ring corresponds to a single card. The third ring in corresponds to the month in which I received the card. And the final ring shows the year.</p>

                        <p>The bar graph shows all of the people that gave me cards over the course of those 12 months.</p>

                        <p>You can hover over each bar to highlight the cards that were sent by that person. Or hover over a color histogram to highlight the the people that gave me that card. Click a histogram to see the actual card.</p>

                        <h3>Processing</h3>
                        <p>I used <a href="http://toxiclibs.org/">toxiclibs</a> and <a href="http://processing.org">Processing</a> to quantize the colors in each image and find the dominant colors in each card. The Processing application loaded all 25 cards and provided controls to tune the quantization threshold and the sampling rate. I selected a threshold and sampling rate that yielded 2â€“3 clearly dominant colors in each card and exported that to a CSV file.</p>

                        <h3>Python</h3>
                        <p>I imported the CSV files generated by my Processing application into CouchDB using a <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> script with the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/couchdb-python/">couchdb-python</a> module. The script attached the images to each JSON document along with the dominant color data. I manually annotated each entry with the sender.</p>

                        <h3>CouchDB</h3>
                        <p>I stored the data in a <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> database for easy access over XHR. The database is hosted by <a href="http://www.iriscouch.com/">Iris Couch</a>.</p>

                        <p>The visualization itself was built as an SVG directly in the DOM using <a href="http://d3js.org/">d3</a>. I used the <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html">Twitter Bootstrap</a> to set up the basics needed for the page, and added <a href="http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/">fancyBox</a> to display the images of each card.</p>
